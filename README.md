# MyBookstore Landing Page
This is a simple and responsive landing page I built to showcase an online bookstore called "MyBookstore." The idea was to create a clean and modern layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## What I Built
The page includes:
- A header with the site logo and navigation links
- A hero section with a headline, short description, and a call-to-action button
- A featured books section with categories like Fiction, History, and Childrenâ€™s Books
- An about section explaining the purpose of the store
- A newsletter sign-up form
- A footer with social media links

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- Flexbox for arranging content
- Media queries for responsiveness

## Folder Structure
project/
|--index.html
|--styles.css
|--images


## How to View It
I used Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension to preview the page locally. You can open `index.html` in the browser and resize the window to see how the layout adjusts on different screen sizes.

## What I Learned
This project helped me practice working with semantic HTML, CSS layout techniques like Flexbox, and using media queries to make content responsive. It also reinforced how to structure a basic landing page with clear sections and call-to-actions.
